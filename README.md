Hello Planet Earth,

Greetings from Rio de Janeiro! My name is Dustin and I am overly excited! Can you believe there is only two days before we start our first coding bootcamp!? I am ready to take on this challenge and excited to see where this new adventure takes us. I think it will be a good idea to take snap shots, write in my journal and organize what I've learned each day.
